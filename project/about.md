## Lego Set Database Explorer  

This Shiny App is for searching and visulizating LEGO Sets information from year 1950 to 2016. The total number of set records is 10691 and that of theme records is 104.
The dataset is from [Rebrickable.com](http://rebrickable.com/) that contains the basic information of each set (set id, year, number of pieces, theme, set name).  

Data Source: http://rebrickable.com/downloads  
**Note**: Since I didn't use the API to collect data, the current data might not be 100% accurate.
